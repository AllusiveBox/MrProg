Updated: 10/13/18

	* Fixed a bug with the iam command that allowed users to change their nickname to their current display name, even though Discord's API doesn't allow this.
	* Updated the error handling on the iam command, should the command fail for any reason.
	* The iam command will now DM users on successful name change, as it's big description indicates it should.
	* Updated the announce command to include a link to the git repo's issue page.
	* Updated how included commands work, getting rid of that nasty eval trick I was using for some reason...?
	* The about command now includes a link to the git repo.
	* Fixed an issue where non-cached members would constantly get an error on attempts to change roles...
	* Removed some unnecessary debugging lines in the rip command.
	* It should no longer be possible for two log messages to be recorded when a member is kicked/banned from a server.
