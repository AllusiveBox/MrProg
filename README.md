# Mr. Prog Ver 4.0.0

Welcome to the Repository for Mr. Prog Version 3.0.0. This is the first version of Mr. Prog that has been publicly posted. 

This is primarily being used as an opportunity to keep my skills relevant, but also as an opportunity to increase my knowledge of github, as well as try a few new things with the current Mr. Prog script.

For those of you who found this, I don’t know how, but there will be a number of early commits where I am just doing small, rather basic, stuff as a refresher, but also as a way to get another look at some of the basics, as it’s been well over a year since I first wrote Mr. Prog’s original script.

In the words of MegaMan Trigger; Here we go!
