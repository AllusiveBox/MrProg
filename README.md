# Mr. Prog Ver 4.0.X

Welcome to the Repository for Mr. Prog Version 4.0.X. This is the first version of Mr. Prog that has been publicly posted. 

This is primarily being used as an opportunity to keep my skills relevant, but also as an opportunity to increase my knowledge of github, as well as try a few new things with the current Mr. Prog script.

For those of you who found this, I don’t know how, but there will be a number of early commits where I am just doing small, rather basic, stuff as a refresher, but also as a way to get another look at some of the basics, as it’s been well over a year since I first wrote Mr. Prog’s original script.

In the words of MegaMan Trigger; Here we go!

# Things to Keep in Mind...

There are a number of files that are excluded from this git repo that are necessary for the bot to run at maximum efficiency, but due to the nature of servers, are redundant to have included in the actual folder. To help rectify this issue, a folder with templates for all the current files that are excluded is included for your convenience. 

# In Addition to the Files Found here...

You will need to make use of node.js, Discord.js, and sqlite3 in order to run your own instance of Mr. Prog.
