	* Purge command is now usable by mods, previously it was admins only which wasn't intended.
	* Purge command now handles things a little better, so that if it does error it won't fail.
		* Somewhere an invalid message object is being generated, though, it'll error on that, but should still be successful.
	* The purgedMessages text file will now attach image links if any were provided, instead of just saying [object Object].
