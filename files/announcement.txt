Updated: 10/30/20

	* Added a new command, `!gameRole` that allows users the ability to add / remove roles from themselves, in a method similar to the `!dendome` and `!alertMe` commands.
		* Currently only roles for Among Us and Monster Hunter World are supported, but more can be added if requested!
	* Added a few missing reactions to commands that the bot recognizes
		* The `!addPoints` and `!subPoints` will now react any time the command used, regardless of if it is successful or not.
		* The `!help` command will now successfully react when an individual command is passed as an argument, regardless of if it is successful or not.
