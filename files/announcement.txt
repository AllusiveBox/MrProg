	* Logging has been split between channels to prevent spam in any single channel.
	* dmLogging has been updated slightly.
	* The rip command now has this nifty thing if you include a string along with the command, check it out...
	* The Avatar command will now log user avatars instead of sending them as DMs. This will prevent everyone from using it in rapid succession.
	* The user database now stores a user's joinDate. Users that have been in the member before this change will have this value set to `null` by default. This will be updated on first post after this update.
	* Now that user's join dates are stored in the database, the joinDate value for each user can now be looked up with the lookup command.
	* The lookup command has been reworked. Formatted messages will now be in the form of an embed, which is spiffy and looks nice. Non-formatted messages will now use the old formatted message formatting.
		* The lookup command has been updated to include the optOut data for a user.
	* It is now possible to get the log files from the bot, using the log command if you are a mod or higher.
	* The optIn and optOut commands now react to commands as originally intended.
