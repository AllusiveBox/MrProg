	* Woowee the last update was back in May. Let's dust this off, shall we?
	* A new command has been added that will generate the link for screensharing for you, since you guys are lazy and can't do it yourself (we kid!). Use `!sc` to get it when in a voice channel.
	* The `!wiki` command has received a wording update to inform users of the `!wikiresources` command if you weren't already aware of it...
	* The `!wikiresources` command has been updated to include some new links to help you with your game needs!
	* Maybe the bot will update again before the year is over...
