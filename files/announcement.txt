	* Score system now should ignore users with null member objects since this is *still* an issue.
	* The rip command has been temporarily removed, until people can stop attempting to ruin good things.
	* Message logging has been further split so that it doesn't clutter the same log channels.
	* Targeted purging has temporarily been disabled due to a stubborn bug that doesn't seem to want to die.
	* Logic has been updated in certain places where needed.
	* Logging on edited / deleted messages now includes the author's name as well as the channel it was deleted in.
	* That stupid error message that happens in score has been fixed so that it has a new line after the user that caused the error.
