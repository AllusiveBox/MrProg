	* Some commands have had reacts added to them, so that at a glance it's easier to tell if they were successful or not. 
	* Commands that DM'd successful completion of their task, but offered no real information, have had their DMs removed and instead will only react to your message.
	* A few commands have had their detailed help text updated.
	* A bug with deleteMe always deleting admins and mods, and not saving their clearance permissions has been resolved.
	* A bug with the n1 command always failing has been resolved. The bot will now once again send out the invite link.
