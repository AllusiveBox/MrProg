	* The April Fools command was removed.
	* A lot of behind the scenes logging things were changed. 
	* Hopefully the annoying discord API error that the bot was getting that prevented a successful hookup should now be fixed, or at the very least, handled correctly so the bot doesn't hang in limbo.
	* Uhhh, I did a few other things too. I really can't remember and can't be bothered to log in the commit log. Nothing really important to normal users, though. Mods might thank me, though.
